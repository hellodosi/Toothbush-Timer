# Toothbush-Timer

(Documentation is still in progress)

A timer for the duration of tooth brushing for children based on an Arduino Nano.
My child hates brushing his teeth and therefore usually brushes very briefly so that he can finish faster. We all know that's not the idea behind it and it's probably similar for your children.
That's why I designed this timer, which shows the time with colorful LEDs and rewards you with a rainbow at the end.

The timer is easy to use: Just a switch to turn it on and off, and a button to start/pause/reset.
It can also be charged via USB-C and used wirelessly with a rechargeable battery.
The Arduino Nano can also be reprogrammed after assembly via the mini-USB interface.

## 3D-Printing the Case
You can find the model for 3D printing for free on Makerworld: <https://makerworld.com/en/models/1239202-led-toothbrush-timer>
Use a filament in the color of your choice for the housing.
However, you should choose a transparent filament for the front cover so that the LED display is not affected.
